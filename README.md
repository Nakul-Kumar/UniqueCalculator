# UniqueCalculator
I made this code, using the help of basic math and sets, it's not very hard, do look out for any errors I made and please give me feedback thanks!
What this code does is basically, takes in a file.
Takes in all the numbers in the fiel as a list,
Tries each number until it get the right value.
So for example if I inputted the number 12345.

The code would simply try to multiply 12 by 3 = 36 then take that product and add 4 = 40, as you can see 3 and 4 have been repeated multiple times, but to find the unique combination, I had created this code, because I was just too lazy to be honest.
Hope you like it, give me feedback!
